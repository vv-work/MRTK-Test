## Middle Technical Task


Status Update:


Making a build of  Outline Solution Demo project v0.3.0 for HoloLens2:



What's included:
2 Scenes

MRTK Shades with URP* on back-end

Scene 1: Has semi-transparent B1040 for space moving and manipulation (basically the very similar scene to the one I showed in the video with Oculus Passthrough)

Tools for color line thickness transparency manipulation

Different UI 3D objects for interacting and manipulation excluded from Outline

Scene 2: Fully transparent with Outline based on the Shapes solution (Outline works only for this object only) Same tools for moving and manipulation

Scene 3: byDemand. I can include old working prototype scenes so the difference in difference in performance and FPS would be more visible But I set this task as priority C. Maybe I will to it somewhere in the future if everything from priority A,B will be fully completed or and if you request that then I will change status from C  to A and will implement and finish it ASAP



Motivation


This build is mainly to deliver measurable results of my progress.

Improve Delivery Pipeline

Improve communication.

I still plan to deliver a good transparent Outline solution today and start its integration into FabStation-HoloLensproject. But to be on the page. I set this milestone(build in the middle) to guaranty deliverance.
